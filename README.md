Project Description
This project focuses on designing and developing a two-dimensional game using Python programming language. Emphasizing scientific, technical, and communication skills, students will collaborate to create a game that incorporates physical elements like trajectories, time, and mass, while providing an interactive user experience through engaging graphics and dynamic feedback indicating the game outcome (win/lose).

Main Features

    Physics-based design: The game will include trajectory calculations and other physical principles for a more realistic experience.
    Graphics and User Interface: Use of graphic libraries such as Tkinter, WxPython, or Pygame to develop the game's user interface and graphics.
    Dynamic feedback: Immediate feedback on player actions with clear indications of the game status (won or lost).

Instructions for Running the Code
To start the game, ensure Python is installed on your system along with the necessary libraries mentioned above. The game can be launched by executing the project's main file through the command line or an IDE that supports Python. Detailed instructions and code examples are provided in the project's documentation files.

Project Contribution
This project is designed to foster collaboration and innovation among engineering students. Contributions can include enhancing existing features, adding new functionalities, documenting, and testing the game to ensure its reliability and performance.

Resources and Documentation
Additional resources, including tutorials on graphic libraries and advice on game design in Python, are available in the project documents. Students are encouraged to review these resources to familiarize themselves with the necessary tools and techniques for project success.

This README is tailored to the goals and requirements of the transversal engineering project for the design of a 2D game in Python, drawing inspiration from the provided example and incorporating specific details of our project based on the available information.

Tools used in this project: VScode, git
